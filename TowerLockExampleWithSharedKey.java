// This code simulates a tower with two rooms: Room 31 and Room 52.
// Originally, each room had its own lock, but due to privacy concerns and lost keys,
// the complex owner decided to use a single main gate lock for the entire tower.
// Now, only one person can be inside the tower at a time, regardless of which room they want to enter.
// Two people (threads) want to access the tower simultaneously‚Äî
// Person A wants to enter Room 31, and Person B wants to enter Room 52.
// However, since there's only one main gate key, if Person A is inside Room 31,
// Person B must wait outside the tower until Person A finishes and exits.
// This ensures complete privacy‚Äîno one else can be inside while someone is in any room.
// The second person enters the tower only after the first person leaves and unlocks the gate.
// Meanwhile, the complex‚Äôs manager (main thread) patiently waits for both people to finish before closing the tower.
//
// You can compile and time the execution on Windows PowerShell using:
// javac demo\threading\TowerLockExampleWithSharedKey.java; Measure-Command { java demo.threading.TowerLockExampleWithSharedKey }
// Since access is sequential due to the shared tower key, the total execution time
// will be approximately the sum of both room visit durations (about 7 seconds).
