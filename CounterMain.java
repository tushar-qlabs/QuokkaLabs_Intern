// Volatile keyword is used to reflect the changes made by one thread to other threads immediately.
// It is used to prevent thread caching and ensure that the value of the variable is always read from the main memory.
// You should use it only when you don't care about the previous value of the variable, and you are not dependent on the previous value.

// We can achieve atomicity by using the synchronized method or block or by using the Atomic classes provided by Java.
// It ensures that only one thread can access the resource at a time, making the operation atomic.

// Atomicity is crucial when your operation depends on the previous value of a variable. For example, in operations like incrementing
// a counter (x++), where you need to read the current value, modify it, and then write it back, atomicity ensures that no other
// thread can interfere during this process.
// If your operation does not depend on the previous value and is simply setting a new value (like x = 5),
// then atomicity isnâ€™t as critical. In such cases, using the volatile keyword might be enough to ensure visibility across threads.

// This class provides atomic operations on integers and are more efficient than using synchronized methods or blocks but are limited for simple operations.
//import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
