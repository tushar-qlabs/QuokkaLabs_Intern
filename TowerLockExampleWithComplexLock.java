// This code simulates an ABC Complex that has multiple towers, each with its own rooms (Room 31, Room 52, etc).
// Due to strict privacy rules, the entire complex now uses a single key shared across all towers.
// This is like having one static lock (class-level lock) shared across all instances.
// Now, if Person A enters Room 31 of Tower-A,
// Person B must wait‚Äîeven if they want to enter a different room in Tower-B.
// Only one person across the **entire complex** can be inside any room of any tower at a time.
// Once that person leaves, the next person can enter.
// Meanwhile, the complex manager (main thread) waits until all visitors are done to close the complex.
//
// You can compile and run this on PowerShell as:
// javac demo\threading\TowerLockExampleWithComplexLock.java; Measure-Command { java demo.threading.TowerLockExampleWithComplexLock }
// Since access is global across towers, execution time is roughly sum of both durations (~7 seconds).
