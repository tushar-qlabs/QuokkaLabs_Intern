// This code simulates a building with two rooms: Room 31 and Room 52.
// Each room has its own unique key (lock), ensuring privacy and exclusive access.
// Two people (threads) want to use the rooms at the same time:
//   - Person A uses the key to Room 31.
//   - Person B uses the key to Room 52.
// Because they use different keys, they can access their rooms concurrently without waiting for each other.
// While Person A is inside Room 31, Person B can independently be inside Room 52.
// Each person locks their room while inside (synchronized on their room's lock) and unlocks it after leaving.
// Meanwhile, the building‚Äôs manager (main thread) waits until both people finish and exit their rooms before closing the building.
//
// To compile and measure execution time on Windows PowerShell:
// javac demo\threading\BuildingLockExampleWithDifferentRoomKeys.java; Measure-Command { java demo.threading.BuildingLockExampleWithDifferentRoomKeys }
// Since both threads run in parallel, the total time will be approximately equal to the longest room usage (4 seconds), not the sum.
