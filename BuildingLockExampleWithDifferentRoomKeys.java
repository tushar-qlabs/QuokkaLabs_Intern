// This code simulates a building with two rooms: Room 31 and Room 52.
// Each room has its own unique key (lock).
// Two people (threads) want to enter the building simultaneously.
// Person A uses the key to Room 31.
// Person B uses the key to Room 52.
// Since they have different keys, both can enter their rooms concurrently without waiting.
// While Person A is inside Room 31, Person B can be inside Room 52 at the same time.
// Each person locks their room while inside (using synchronized on that room's lock).
// When finished, they leave and unlock the room.
// Meanwhile, the building‚Äôs manager (main thread) waits until both leave before closing the building.
//
// To time the execution from the console, run:
// javac demo\threading\BuildingLockExampleWithDifferentRoomKeys.java; Measure-Command { java demo.threading.BuildingLockExampleWithDifferentRoomKeys }
// The total time will be roughly the longest sleep time (4 seconds), showing concurrent access.
