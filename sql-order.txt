SQL syntactical and execution order:

1. General Syntactical Order (How we write it):

Here’s the correct and full order of SQL clauses when writing queries:

SELECT – What columns you want
FROM – The base table
JOIN – Any other tables you want to join
ON – The condition for the join
WHERE – Filter rows before grouping
GROUP BY – Group rows
HAVING – Filter grouped rows
ORDER BY – Sort results
LIMIT / OFFSET – Pagination

2. Logical Execution Order (How the database processes it):

This is the sequence the database actually follows to process the data, which is different from how you write the query. --

FROM / JOIN – Get tables, link them up)
WHERE – Filter individual rows)
GROUP BY – Group rows together)
HAVING – Filter those groups)
SELECT – Pick columns, do calculations)
DISTINCT – Remove duplicate rows)
ORDER BY – Sort the final results)
LIMIT / OFFSET – Show specific number of results)
